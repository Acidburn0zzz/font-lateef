# Lateef Graphite Font

Lateef is an extended Arabic script font designed by SIL International for
modern Unicode-based systems.

Named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi mystic and
poet, this font is intended to be an appropriate style for use in
Sindhi and other languages of the southern Asia.

## Project status

This is an **unreleased development** effort currently focused on the following goals:

- Implement shaping behavior consistent with
[Lateef 1.001](http://www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts/lateef) but using [SIL Graphite](https://graphite.sil.org) technology rather than OpenType.
- Build the font using [SMITH](https://github.com/silnrsi/smith) toolchain.

See the FONTLOG.txt for information on this and previous releases.
