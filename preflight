# For now, just normalize Regular
psfnormalize source/Lateef-Regular.ufo

# Eventually we'll get to using the following: 

# sync metadata to other UFOs and normalize again
# psfsyncmeta source/*Regular.ufo --normalize

# [re-]build woff metadata file
# psfmakewoffmetadata -n Lateef -i org.sil.fonts source/*-Regular.ufo
